# Milestone-Project-2 : Find a MMA GYM

# Introduction

This site was created to give people information about good MMA gyms in Ireland. The idea for the website was born when my current employer sent me for training in another town , and was put in a position to look for one.

This is my second milestone on my Code Institute course, in which I was given the instructions to make an Interactive Front End Project.
